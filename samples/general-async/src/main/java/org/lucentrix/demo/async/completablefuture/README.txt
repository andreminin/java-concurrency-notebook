CompletableFuture

CompletableFuture is a class introduced in Java 8 that represents a future result of an asynchronous computation.
It provides a rich API for composing, combining, and executing asynchronous operations.
Key Features:

    Asynchronous execution with various thread pools

    Chaining of multiple operations

    Exception handling in async pipelines

    Combining multiple futures

    Manual completion control


Key Takeaways:

    CompletableFuture provides a powerful way to handle asynchronous programming with fluent API for composition and error handling.

    VarHandle offers type-safe, performant access to variables with fine-grained memory ordering control, replacing the
     need for Unsafe operations.

    Together they enable building robust, high-performance concurrent applications with proper memory visibility guarantees.

    VarHandle is particularly useful for implementing custom concurrent data structures and atomic operations beyond
    what's provided in java.util.concurrent.atomic.

This combination represents modern Java concurrency practices that are both safe and performant.
